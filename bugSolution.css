To solve the specificity issue, adjust the specificity of the selectors. This might involve using more specific selectors for the general style rules or using the !important flag (although this is generally discouraged) for the more important selectors. In some cases, restructuring the HTML or using CSS preprocessors like Sass or Less can help improve readability and maintainability, reducing the chances of such issues.
